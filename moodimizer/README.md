## What Moodimizer does:

  - Have you ever had those day, where you just didn't know what you wanted to do? 
  <br><br>
  So you think and think about it...and then you end up saying at home not really doing anything and wasting your day away.<br><br>
  Moodimizer takes that hassle of thinking really hard, and gives you plenty of suggestions on what to do based on what you're in the mood for!

## Goals:

  - To reduce traffic flow of thoughts
  - To make life more adventurous but in a efficient way.
